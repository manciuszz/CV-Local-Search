### The idea
.. was to make a browser extension to scrape popular job/practice websites for information and then manipulate that information into neat tables for viewing.

### Used tech

Extensionizr -> https://extensionizr.com
HTML / CSS
Bootstrap 
Angular.JS 
jQuery 

### Further plans / TODO

I can see a lot of potential here... to the point where I'm too lazy to type it out.
